## Key Features

* Local "Beacon" Server 
  - A beacon-server script that Abstrakt will communicate with to receive updates, commands or other information.
* Silent Background operation 
  - Customizable with various options including a `no-console` launcher that compiles and runs the script quietly until forcefully terminated by Host or `!kill` command or equivalent is issued from Beacon.
* Lightwork, and clock-work
  - Goes easy on hardware that isn't too powerful thanks to it's IRPV algorithm, Intelligent Resource Provisioner, that actively checks hardware resource usage and adjusts its own depending on instructions from Beacon or task-kill list parameters.
* Sleeper-mode^
  - Script can change its behavior to avoid detection some include ceasing log-file creations, changing its process name, creating a setup/helper script that will respawn Abstrakt after its removal, or spawn `guard-dog` instances.
  - Special thanks to our hardworking watch-dogs for this one, as they are restlessly watching Abstrakt and restarting it upon termination and reporting back incident to Beacon.
<br></br>
  > `Guard-dog` instances are scripts that attempt to evade system process-kill by using various methods, customizable with Beacon.
  > Note that, in this context, `Guard-dogs` are not related to `watch-dogs`.

* Custom Timeout interval 
  - Processes restarting too fast? Not a problem. You can adjust the timeout check-interval to check more often. or you 
* Whitelists and Blacklists
  - Know who's friend and who's foe? Send out `whitelist.json` and `blacklist.json` files from the Beacon and Abstrakt will take care of the rest.
  - Don't which process is critical? Abstrakt can fetch a list of all currently running processes and send it back to Beacon. You can then manually whitelist running processes, such as system processes and Abstrakt itself, and blacklist the rest or configure the Beacon to automatically do that instead, if it suits your needs.
  - Option to export the process list locally as `.txt` or send it to Beacon as `.json` within a pre-specified interval.
* Supports Group Mode* 
  - Group mode makes it possible for Abstrakt to run simultaneously with other Abstrakt instances and won't terminate them. To activate it, simply send a command from the Beacon.
* Options for Exporting the running processes list
  - Option to export the process list locally as `.txt` or send it to Beacon as `.json`.

  > ^ Log files are always sent back to Beacon regardless of this setting. 
  > Beacon-server, sleeper-mode, task-kill list, multiple instances, advanced IRPV configuration and certain other features may only be available to `Abstrakt Pro` releases.
